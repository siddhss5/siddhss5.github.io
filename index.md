I am the Boeing Endowed Professor at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I moved to UW in 2017 after 18 years at [The Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). GeekWire has a couple of articles about the [move](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/robotics-expert-moves-entire-team-university-washington-including-famous-oreo-cracking-robot/) and my continued love for [Pittsburgh](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/pittsburgh-profile-robotics-expert-sidd-srinivasa-love-steel-city-leap-seattle/). I founded the 
[Personal Robotics Lab](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/) in 2005. I am an [IEEE Fellow](https://www.washington.edu/news/2017/11/28/two-uw-professors-elevated-to-ieee-fellows/) for _contributions to robotic manipulation and human-robot interaction_.

I AM A FULL-STACK ROBOTICIST.
