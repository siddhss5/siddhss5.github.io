I am a Professor at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I moved to UW in 2017 after 18 years at [The Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). GeekWire has a couple of articles about the [move](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/robotics-expert-moves-entire-team-university-washington-including-famous-oreo-cracking-robot/) and my continued love for [Pittsburgh](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/pittsburgh-profile-robotics-expert-sidd-srinivasa-love-steel-city-leap-seattle/). I founded the 
[Personal Robotics Lab](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/) in 2005. I am an [IEEE Fellow](https://www.washington.edu/news/2017/11/28/two-uw-professors-elevated-to-ieee-fellows/) for _contributions to robotic manipulation and human-robot interaction_.

I AM A FULL-STACK ROBOTICIST.

I enjoy proving theorems (our work on Lazy Planning has won back to back best paper awards at [ICAPS 2018](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/haghtalab2018laziness.pdf) and [ICAPS 2019](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/mandalika2019gls.pdf)) and designing algorithms 
([CBiRRT](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/berenson2011task.pdf),
[CHOMP](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/zucker2013chomp.pdf),
[BIT*](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/gammell2015bitstar.pdf),
[Legibility](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/dragan2013legibility.pdf) ...), 
but I'm most passionate about building end-to-end systems 
like [HERB](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/srinivasa2012herb.pdf)
(who starred in an [Oreo commercial](https://vimeo.com/63348513)!),
[ADA](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/blog/food-manipulation/)
(featured on [IEEE](http://theinstitute.ieee.org/technology-topics/robotics/ieee-members-build-robots-to-help-people-with-disabilities-live-independently) and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-47723167/robot-arm-can-feed-people-with-mobility-issues))
,
[CHIMP](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/stentz2015chimp.pdf), and 
[MuSHR](https://mushr.io/), among others, that integrate machine learning, perception, planning, and control in the real world. 
My algorithms have run on the [NASA Robonaut](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/koval2015mpf.pdf)
and the [Mars rover](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/king2016objectcentric.pdf), and have been used by [Google](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/klingensmith2015chisel.pdf) to perform room-sized 3D reconstruction _real-time_ on the [Google Project Tango mobile phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BNOsxMZD14), among others.

I have led large projects, including [Intel's research in robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-4PTyQ8RX8), the [Quality of Life Technologies NSF ERC](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/srinivasa2012herb.pdf), the [DARPA ARM-S](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/king2013pregrasp.pdf), [DARPA Robotics Challenge](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/dellin2014guided.pdf), and most recently the [HONDA Curious Minded Machine program](https://cmm.usa.honda-ri.com/) and [DARPA RACER](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2022-01-13) I was an author of the [Roadmap for US Robotics](http://archive2.cra.org/ccc/files/docs/2013-Robotics-Roadmap) that was presented to Congress in 2013, ran [RSS Robotics: Science and Systems 2017](http://rss2017.lids.mit.edu/), and am an Editor for [The International Journal of Robotics Research](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/ijr).

My lab has over [100 alumni](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/people/). My PhD students and postdocs are faculty at top schools (Berkeley, CMU, Michigan, Technion, USC, ...), industry (Boston Dynamics, Facebook, Google, iRobot, Waymo, ...), and have started companies like [Zordi](https://www.zordi.com/). 
Together we have developed software frameworks such as [OpenRAVE](http://openrave.org/) and [DART](https://dartsim.github.io/).

I am a _first wave founder_ of [Berkshire Grey](https://www.berkshiregrey.com), which focuses on material handling, where I spent 2014-2017. Berkshire Grey is currently trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange as $BGRY. After moving to Seattle, I started Amazon's [Robotics AI](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/robotics) Organization in 2018, focusing on inventing and deploying Robotics and AI in Fulfillment. At Amazon, I lead a team of ~400 people spread across the world.
 

I have been [live on the BBC](https://twitter.com/HERB_UW/status/931711971732307968), on the cover of [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2011/08/robots/), and have an [IMDB page,](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7961061/) but my robot HERB is way [more famous](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/press/) and we've starred together in numerous shows including [_Going Deep_ with David Rees](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/robot-herb-opens-a-refrigerator-door-2014-7). I am deeply committed to STEM, and always excited to talk about robots to a [broad audience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25OQuThxKCc).

Nowadays, I like to play tennis. I've [run competitively](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/130400313), captained the CMU squash team, and played tennis and badminton for IIT Madras.
