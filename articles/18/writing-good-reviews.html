      <h1>Writing Good Reviews</h1>
<p class="subtitle">August 27, 2018</p>

<p>Reviewing papers is one of the most important roles of an academic. But yet, we provide surprisingly little guidance to our reviewers on the <em>tone</em> of their reviews. I tried to capture some of my thoughts in this email I sent to my reviewers when I ran RSS 2017.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Dear X,</p>

<p>Thank you, again, for serving as a reviewer for RSS 2017!</p>

<p>Reviewers are the life-blood of a conference. Your high quality reviews are critical not only for the authors but also for me and for the continued success of RSS. I know you have a lot of experience reviewing, so I will keep this very short and specific.</p>

<p>I’d like your reviews to be compassionate, constructive, and scholarly.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Compassionate</strong>: invert your position and ask yourself how you’d feel if you received your review. If it makes your blood boil, take a break, and revise your review.</li>
  <li><strong>Constructive</strong>: I’d like us to believe that every paper has a best paper award winner hidden in it. Your role is to guide the author to reveal it.</li>
  <li><strong>Scholarly</strong>: cite your sources, do not make claims like <em>“I do not feel this is true”</em> [your feelings matter to me, but probably not to science]. Do not hawk your viewpoint. And please, absolutely no ad hominem attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a reviewer, your role is to comment on the paper’s quality to help the program committee reach an informed decision. So, please refrain from saying things like <em>“This paper should be rejected from RSS”</em> in the main body of the review. You’re welcome to add it to the private comments to the committee.</p>

<p>Finally, I am sure that if you try hard [or sometimes not that hard] to investigate the true identity of your authors, you would likely be able to do it [with high probability]. But, please do not use that as grounds for rejection. Instead of saying <em>“I think that the author of this paper is Joe Biden, and this looks a lot like Joe’s 2015 paper”</em>, just say <em>“Here are the ways this paper is similar to Joe Biden’s 2015 paper”</em>. In a similar vein, do not punish authors for not citing non peer reviewed content [like arXiv or workshop papers].</p>

<p>Your Area Chairs and I will be monitoring your reviews and providing you some feedback as this unfolds.</p>

<p>Happy reviewing!</p>

<p>Please contact me if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Thank you, again!</p>

<p>Sidd.</p>

<h2 id="conflicts-of-interest">Conflicts of Interest</h2>

<p>In addition to the usual conflict rules, I’d recommend another simple rule: if you feel like you cannot comment on the paper in an unbiased manner, decline to review it. I often find people <em>vested</em> in a research topic to be the worst reviewers, digging in stubbornly to their viewpoint and refusing to give other ideas a fair listen. The more knowledgable you are, the more <em>enlightened</em> you ought to be about other viewpoints.</p>

<h2 id="rapoports-rules-of-criticism-as-stated-by-dennet">Rapoport’s Rules of Criticism as stated by Dennet</h2>

<p>Finally, I’d like to leave you with perhaps the most <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rapoport%27s_Rules">succinct summary</a> on how to compose a critical commentary:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “<em>Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should mention anything you have learned from your target.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
